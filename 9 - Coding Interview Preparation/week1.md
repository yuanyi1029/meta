# Week 1 Notes

## Types of Interviews
Interviews are a method for companies to identify a good candidate match for a specific job opening with each company having its own way of conducting the interview process.

Job-application interview stages:
1. Initial Screening
2. Quiz / Take-home Assessment
3. Technical Interview

## The STAR Method 
The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is a structured approach used in interviews to respond to behavioral questions.

The STAR method structure:
1. Situation - Explain a project and challenges faced by you
1. Task - Explain your responsibilities and assignments
1. Action - Explain your actions that addresses the situation
1. Result - Explain the results of your actions

## Memory 
Computer memory is the electronic component where data is stored and retrieved for processing by the CPU.

Types of memory:
- Cache Memory
    - Cache memory is the memory closest to the CPU that provides high-speed data access to it and stores frequently accessed machine data.
- Main Memory (RAM & ROM)
    - Main memory is the internal memory that holds information that a machine is currently working on.
- Secondary Memory 
    - Secondary memory is external memory that can be plugged into a machine externally used to increase the storage capacity of the system (E.g. Cloud Storage, External Hard Drives, USBs). It is often slower to access because data needs to be transferred to RAM before being read.

## Time and Space Complexity
Time complexity is a measure of the computational speed of an algorithm while space complexity is a measure of the memory efficiency of an algorithm, both are represented by the Big-O notation. 

Big-O notations from best to worst:
1. O(1)
2. O(log n)
3. O(n)
4. O(nlog n)
5. O(n ^ k)
6. O(k ^ n)
7. O(n!)
