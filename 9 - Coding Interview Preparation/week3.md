# Week 2 Notes

## Sorting Algorithms 
A sorting algorithm is a systematic process for arranging elements in a data structure into a specific order, such as from smallest to largest.

Example sorting algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort

## Searching Algorithms 
A sorting algorithm is a systematic process for locating and retriveing a particular element within a data structure.

Example searching algorithms:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

## Divide and Conquer Paradigm
The divide and conquer paradigm is a problem-solving approach where a complex problem is recursively divided into smaller subproblems that are solved independently and then combined to solve the original complex problem.

## Recursion
Recursion is a programming concept that utilises the concept of the divide and conquer paradigm  where a function calls itself with a smaller instance of a problem repeatedly until some exit condition is met. A recursive function must have a base case and a recursive case to avoid infinite recursion.

## Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a programming concept that utilises the concept of the divide and conquer paradigm by breaking down complex problems into simpler overlapping subproblems, solving them only once and then storing their solutions to optimize the overall computation.
