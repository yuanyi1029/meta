## Data Structures 
A data structure is a specialized format for storing and processing data to perform various operations efficiently. Data structures can be linear where data are structured in a sequential manner (E.g. Stack, Queue), or non-linear where data are structured in a hierarchical manner (E.g. Tree, Graph)

Simple data structures:  
- Arrays
- Objects  
- Lists
- Sets 
- Stacks 
- Queues
- Trees

Advanced data structures:  
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Graphs
