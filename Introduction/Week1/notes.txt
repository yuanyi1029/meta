A Web server:
1) Handles Website storage & administration
2) Handles web requests from clients

Webpage vs Website
Webpage - Document that displays images, text, videos & other content
Website - A collection of webpages that link together

Web hosting 
Service provided by hosting companies to place webpage files
1) Shared Hosting
- Pay for a single shared web server with other renters
2) Virtual Private Hosting
- Pay for a virtual private server, renters share hardware but do not share
the same server. All servers are virtual machines sharing the same hardware
3) Dedicated Hosting
- Pay for a dedicated physical server
4) Cloud Hosting
- Pay for a cloud environment. Cloud environment spans across multiple 
physical & virtual servers. If a server fails, the webpage will run on a 
different server and stay online

Internet Protocols for Packets
1) Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Protocol used to send packets that must arrive in order such as text or image
files
2) User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Protocol used to send packets that can tolerate data loss such as voice calls 
or video streaming






Sorting Algorithms sorts an array of elements

Types of Algorithms for sorting:
1) Selection Sort - sorting by finding smallest and place it accordingly
2) Bubble Sort  - sorting by comparing 2 elements and swap places, repeat until sorted 
3) Merge Sort - sorting 2 halves and compare the smallest element of each halve

Selection Sort:
Loops through the entire array, look for the smallest element and swap places
with the first element of the unsorted part 

Bubble Sort:
Loops through the array constantly checking between 2 elements and swap places if
the elements are in the wrong order, repeat this process until the array is sorted
(generally moves high values to the right and low values to the left)

Merge Sort:
Sort 2 halves of the array, compare the smallest element of each halve, then
get the smallest element and put it in a new array 


-------------------------------- Running Time ---------------------------------
All algorithms have a running time which represents roughly how fast / slow the algorithm is
(represented by O)

Slowest to Fastest running times:  
O(n ^ 2) > O(n log n) > O(n) > O(log n) > O(1)          

Linear search has a running time of O(n)
Binary search has a running time of O(log n)

Linear sort has a running time of O(n ^ 2) 
Bubble sort has a running time of O(n ^ 2)           
Bubble sort has a running time of O(n log n)           
 
-------------------------------- Data Structure -------------------------------
Data structures are a specialized way of storing and processing data 
Arrays are a type of data structure that allows us to store data back-to-back
Modern programming languages allows us to invent our own data structures

Implementing a new data structure:
    typedef struct
    {
        // variables
    }
    structure_name

---------------------------------- Recursion ----------------------------------
A programming technique that makes a function call itself as part of its execution

Basic reuirements for a recursive function:
Base case           (will terminate the recusive process when triggered)
Recursive case      (function calls itself that solves a smaller range of the problem)
