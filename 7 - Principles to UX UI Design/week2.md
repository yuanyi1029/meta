Ben Shneidermann's 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design

4. Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels
5. Make navigation options clear and consistent
6. Provide easily identifiable feedback
7. Use headings and spacing to group related content

9. Provide controls for content that starts automatically

## Form Design Best Practices 
A well-designed form improves the user experience and increases conversions where users are more likely to turn into customers. The following are the best practices and guidelines for a form design:
1. Use one column
2. Clearly label a form
3. Sort form fields from the simplest to most difficult 
4. Make use of inline form field validation 
5. Form text should be aligned to the left
6. Do not request phone numbers if possible
7. Use browser auto-fill 
8. Create mobile-friendly forms
9. Error messages should be positive
10. Include smart defaults
11. Add progress bars for long forms 
12. Use reCAPTCHAs rather than CAPTCHAs 
13. Allow users to navigate to the next form field by the Tab key

## Component Library
A component library is a set of pre-made UI components that can be easily reused across the user interface of a product where it ensures that it has a consistent look which promotes efficiency and scalability.

## Menu Icons in Navigation
Navigation icons are the main methods of helping users find content and information in an application with the click of a single button. The following are some example menu icons:
1. Hamburger Menu
2. Kebab menu
3. Meatballs menu
4. Bento menu
5. DÃ¶ner menu
